# SetupForMe

This is a setup script for setting up [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim).

# Prerequisite
* ZSH
* python3-pip
* Font: [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) are highly recommended.

It is very easy to use, you just need to
```
./generate_env.sh
./setup.sh
```

Please make sure you know how shell or vim works to avoid an unpleasant experience.
Where the vim window prompts, just wait for the finish of plugin installation and then quit the vim.
